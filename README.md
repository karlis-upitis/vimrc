# vimrc
My default configuration for vim using Vundle.

## Installing
First you need a [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) (plug-in manager for vim)
```
git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
```

Then you need to put a `.vimrc` file in your home folder. I prefer to do symlink to the home folder.
```
git clone https://github.com/karlisup/vimrc.git ~/dotfiles/vimrc
ln -s ~/dotfiles/vimrc/.vimrc ~/.vimrc
```
## Description
VIM configuration. It feels like working with Sublime Text editor, but better.
Just some functionality I applied to VIM:
* emmet awesomness
* bracket creating the way you like (when writing CSS)
* NerdTree for navigation
* highlighting (nice theme)
